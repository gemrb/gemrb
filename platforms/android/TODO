- add a dialog on first run to prompt for GamePath (add.: make this a full-fledged configuration screen please)
- version checks for override, unhardcoded and GUIScripts (unneccessary, seeing as the .apk extracts version-appropriate folders)
- mouse cursor seems to get positioned at the corners of the screen touches for some reason, most likely not directly related to the android build though
- touches have to be rather quick to register as click events, might be related to SDL20Driver::ProcessFirstTouch()

- replace the renderer/texture bits with SDL_GetWindowSurface and SDL_UpdateWindowSurface for performance, trading in scalability
  * possible as a checkbox?
- configuration screen on first start, config selector on subsequent starts
