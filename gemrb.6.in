GemRB
\- emulator for Infinity Engine-based games

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gemrb
[\-c
.IR CONFIG-FILE ]
.br
.B torment
.br

.\"###################################################
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B GemRB
is an emulator for Infinity Engine-based games, fine RPGs like Baldur's Gate,
Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment.

.B GemRB
reimplements only the game engine. To actually play anything, you have to have
the data from the original game(s), installed or unpackaged where GemRB can find it.
See the
.I GamePath
and
.I CDn
settings in the engine configuration file below. A full install is recommended.

.\"###################################################
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c " FILE"
Use the specified configuration file
.IR FILE " instead"
of the default
.IR gemrb.cfg .

.B Note:
You can also use the program's name as a mean to select the configuration file.
For example, if the program's name is
.I torment
instead of
.IR gemrb ,
the engine first searches for
.I torment.cfg
and only if it's not found it searches for
.IR gemrb.cfg .

To use this feature, just create a symbolic link
.I torment
pointing to the
.I gemrb
binary and then run
.IR torment
instead.

.\"###################################################
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PD 0
A configuration file consists of pairs
.IR PARAMETER=VALUE ,
each on its own line. The case of PARAMETER is not significant,
GameType is the same as GAMETYPE. If the same PARAMETER is defined
more than once, only the last occurrence is used.

Empty lines and lines starting with `#' (hash sign) are ignored.

At least the
.I GamePath
parameter needs to be changed. That is often enough, so do not fiddle with the other paths too much.

.SH General Parameters:

.TP
.BR GameType =(auto|bg1|bg2|iwd|iwd2|how|pst)
Type of the game. The value is a name of subdirectory in override/
and GUIScripts/ directories
with game type-specific files and scripts. It is at present also used
for various tweaks hardcoded in the GemRB engine. To autodetect the game
type, use the default "auto".

.TP
.BR GameName =STRING
Arbitrary name of the game. It will be displayed in the window's title bar.

.TP
.BR Encoding =(default|polish|czech|german)
Specify language used in the game data.

.TP
.BR GUIEnhancements =INT
The value is a bitfield. Set it to 1 to enable a few GUI enhancements, mostly in BG2.
Set to 2 or 3 to try to autoidentify items on transfer (if the character has enough lore).
Disabled by default.

.TP
.BR EndianSwitch =(0|1)
Set this to 1 if you are running GemRB on a big-endian machine. Disabled by default.

.TP
.BR MultipleQuickSaves =(0|1)
EXPERIMENTAL. Set this to 1 if you want GemRB to keep multiple quicksaves around. Disabled by default.

.TP
.BR MaxPartySize =INT
EXPERIMENTAL: Set this to 1-10 if you want more party members or enforce fewer. 6 by default.
.B NOTE:
You need to choose a big enough resolution, so there will be enough room for all the party portraits! Does nothing for PST and IWD2.

.\"###################################################
.SH Video Parameters:

.TP
.BR Width =INT
Game window width (in pixels).

.B WARNING:
This is not arbitrary but depends on the game data. For custom resolutions
the widescreen mod needs to be used.

.TP
.BR Height =INT
Game window height (in pixels).

.B WARNING:
This is not arbitrary but depends on the game data. For custom resolutions
the widescreen mod needs to be used.

.TP
.BR Bpp =INT
Color depth of the game window (in bits per pixel).

.TP
.BR Fullscreen =(0|1)
Whether the game should run in fullscreen mode.

.TP
.BR TooltipDelay =INT
Delay (in milliseconds) before tooltips are displayed when the mouse is not moving.
A reasonable number for this option is e.g.
.IR 500 .
The default is
.IR 100 .

.TP
.BR SkipIntroVideos =(0|1)
If set to
.IR 1 ,
the intro and logo videos are skipped to save developer's nerves. The default is
.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR FogOfWar =(0|1)
If set to
.IR 1 ,
the unexplored parts of an area are blacked out. It is enabled by default.


.\"###################################################
.SH Audio Parameters:

.TP
.BR AudioDriver =(openal|sdlaudio|none)
Use the specified plugin as the audio driver. The default is openal, while
.I none
will disable all audio.

.\"###################################################
.SH Path parameters:

.TP
.BR CaseSensitive =(0|1)
When
this parameter is set to
.IR 1 ,
the engine will try to find files regardless of their names' case at the cost
of a slight speed penalty. This is especially important when using
game files on CD-ROMs, where the files can't be renamed. Like
many Windows programs, the original games use inconsistent mix
of lower/upper case letters for naming and referencing their files.

Set this parameter to
.I 1
on Unix-like systems.

.TP
.BR GamePath =PATH
Path to the directory where the original game is installed. If you can't
install the game under MS Windows or with WINE, you can try to unpack the data files
with the
.I unshield
program found at
.IR http://synce.sourceforge.net .

.TP
.BR CD1 =PATH
.TP
.BR CD2 =PATH
.TP
.BR CDn =...
Path to the data files for the game's particular CDs or any other data sources.

.TP
.BR CachePath =PATH
User-writable directory where the engine caches uncompressed and temporary
files. Defaults to a subdirectory of the current directory.

.TP
.BR GemRBPath =PATH
Path to the GemRB installation. (To be obsoleted; preset at build time).

.TP
.BR GUIScriptsPath =PATH
Path to the directory with scripts controlling the game's GUI. (To be obsoleted; preset at build time).

.TP
.BR GemRBOverridePath =PATH
Path where GemRB looks for its game override directory.
It defaults to
.IR GemRBPath .
GemRB reuses some of the unused files from the original or replaces them
and this is the where they can be found. The path is preset at build time.
This directory has the highest priority when searching, so putting files in
the game override will not affect them. Use another directory and add it as
.IR ModPath
to the GemRB config.

.TP
.BR GemRBUnhardcodedPath =PATH
Path where GemRB looks for its unhardcoded engine data.
It defaults to
.IR GemRBPath .
The original games hardcoded this information in the engine.
The path is preset at build time.

.TP
.I The following variables do not need to be altered, unless you are doing something really special!

.TP
.BR SavePath =PATH
Path to the directory with save games. Note that this directory has to
contain
.I save/
and/or eventually
.I mpsave/
subdirectories and that only these subdirectories contain the actual
saved games.

.I SavePath
defaults to
.IR GamePath .

.TP
.BR GameDataPath =PATH
Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's
.IR data .

.TP
.BR GameOverridePath =PATH
Path to the original game's override dir, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's
.IR override .
Original games use this directory to place last-minute patches.

.TP
.BR GameCharactersPath =PATH
Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's
.IR characters .

.TP
.BR GamePortraitsPath =PATH
Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's
.IR portraits .

.TP
.BR GameScriptsPath =PATH
Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's
.IR scripts .

.TP
.BR GameSoundsPath =PATH
Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's
.IR sounds .

.TP
.BR ModPath =PATH
Path where GemRB looks for additional engine override files.
It is not set by default. This directory has precedence over
.IR GemRBOverridePath .

.TP
.BR CustomFontPath =PATH
Path where GemRB looks for additional font files. It is meant to be used
with the TTF font plugin and fonts.2da as a way to specify where to look for
system or other external fonts. Check the online documentation for the details.
It is not set by default.
