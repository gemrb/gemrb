\- emulator for Infinity Engine-based games

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B torment
.br

.\"###################################################
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gemrb
is an emulator for Infinity Engine-based games, fine RPGs like Baldur's Gate,
Icewind Dale or Planescape: Torment. 

.I gemrb
is only an engine; to actually play anything you have to have 
data from the original games installed where they can be found by 
.IR gemrb .

.\"###################################################
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
.I FILE
.br
use other configuration file than default
.IR gemrb.cfg .  

.B Note:
You can also use program's name as a mean to select the configuration file.
For example, if the program's name is 
.I torment 
instead of
.IR gemrb ,
the engine first seaches for 
.I torment.cfg 
and only if it's not found it searches for 
.IR gemrb.cfg .

To use this feature, just create a symbolic link
.I torment
pointing to
.I gemrb
binary and run
.IR torment .

.\"###################################################
.SH Configuration File
.PD 0
Configuration file consists of pairs
.IR PARAMETER=VALUE ,
each on its own line. The case of PARAMETER is not significant, 
GameType is the same as GAMETYPE. If the same PARAMETER is defined 
more than once, only the last occurence is used.

Empty lines and lines starting with `#' (hash sign) are ignored.

.B Parameters:

.TP
.BR GameType =(bg1|bg2|iwd|iwd2|how|pst)
Type of the game. The value is a name of subdirectory in override/ 
and GUIScripts/ directories
with game type-specific files and scripts. It is at present also used
for various tweaks hardcoded in GemRB engine.

.TP
.BR GameName =STRING
Arbitrary name of the game. It will be displayed in the window's title bar.

.TP
.BR GamePath =PATH
Path to the directory where the original game is installed. If you can't
install the game under MS Windows or with WINE, you can try to unpack the data files
with the
.I unshield
program found at 
.IR http://synce.sourceforge.net .

.TP
.BR CD1 =PATH
.TP
.BR CD2 =PATH
.TP
.BR CDn =...
Path to the data files for the game's particular CDs.

.\".TP
.\".BR INIConfig =FILE
.\"Name of the game's INI file, relative to 
.\".IR GamePath .
.\"E.g. for Baldur's Gate game it is baldur.ini.


.TP
.BR Width =INT
Game window width (in pixels).

.TP
.BR Height =INT
Game window height (in pixels).

.TP
.BR Bpp =INT
Color depth of the game window (in bits per pixel).

.TP
.BR Fullscreen =(0|1)
Whether the game should run in fullscreen mode. (Note that fullcreen mode is
currently buggy).

.\".TP
.\".BR ForceStereo =(0|1)
.\"Some older games such as BG1 and PST need this parameter to be 
.\".IR 1 .
.\"For other game types set it to
.\".IR 0 .

.TP
.BR TooltipDelay =INT
Delay (in ms) before tooltips are displayed when the mouse is not moving.
Reasonable number for this option is e.g.
.IR 500 .

.TP
.BR VolumeAmbients =INT
Volume of ambient sounds in percents. The default is
.IR 100 .

.TP
.BR VolumeMovie =INT
Volume during movie playback in percents. The default is
.IR 100 .

.TP
.BR VolumeMusic =INT
Volume of background music in percents. The default is
.IR 100 .

.TP
.BR VolumeSFX =INT
Volume of sound effects in percents. The default is
.IR 100 .

.TP
.BR VolumeVoices =INT
Volume of PC or NPC voices in percents. The default is
.IR 100 .


.TP
.BR SkipIntroVideos =(0|1)
This parameter is meant for developers. If set to
.IR 1 ,
the intro and logo videos are skipped to save developer's nerves. The default is
.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR DrawFPS =(0|1)
This parameter is meant for developers. If set to
.IR 1 ,
the current FPS (Frames per Second) value is drawn in the top left window corner. The default is
.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR FogOfWar =(0|1)
This parameter is meant for developers. If set to
.IR 1 ,
the unexplored parts of an area are blacked out. Since the unexplored bitmap is
not updated by actors yet, it's set to
.I 0 
by default.

.TP
.BR EnableCheatKeys =(0|1)
This parameter is meant for developers. If set to
.IR 1 ,
certain keys allow you to inspect the internal state of objects, do forbidden things, etc.
The keys are listed in the
.I CheatKeys.txt
file. Do NOT use this option unless you want to make your hands dirty :-). The default is
.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR ScriptDebugMode =(n)
This parameter is meant for developers. It is a combination of bit values

.IR 1
- count references,

.IR 2
- display cutscene warnings,

.IR 4
- display variable warnings,

.IR 8
- display action warnings,

.IR 16
- display trigger warnings.

The default is
.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR CaseSensitive =(0|1)
When 
this parameter is set to 
.IR 1 ,
the engine will try to find files regardless of their names' case at the cost
of a slight speed penalty. This is especially important when using
game files on CD-ROMs, where the files can't be renamed. Like 
many Windows programs, the original games use inconsistent mix
of lower/upper case letters for naming and referencing their files. 

Set this parameter to 
.I 1
on Unix-like systems.

.TP
.BR DelayPlugin =FILENAME
Named plugin will be loaded after other (nondelayed) plugins were loaded.
.IR FILENAME 
is a name without path, but with extension, for example
.IR libNullSound.so 
or
.IR libNullSound.dll .
You can use this parameter more than once.

.TP
.BR SkipPlugin =FILENAME
Named plugin will not be loaded.
.IR FILENAME 
is a name without path, but with extension, for example
.IR libNullSound.so 
or
.IR libNullSound.dll .
You can use this parameter more than once.

.TP
.BR SaveAsOriginal =(0|1)
Set this parameter to
.IR 1 ,
if you want to keep the save game compatible with the original engine.

.TP
.BR CachePath =PATH
User-writable directory where the engine caches uncompressed and temporary
files.

.TP
.BR GemRBPath =PATH
Path to the GemRB installation. (To be obsoleted).

.TP
.BR GUIScriptsPath =PATH
Path to the directory with scripts controlling the game's GUI. 

.TP
.BR SavePath =PATH
Path to the directory with save games. Note that this directory has to
contain 
.I save/
and/or eventually
.I mpsave/
subdirectories and that only these subdirectories contain the actual
saved games.

.I SavePath
defaults to
.IR GamePath .

.TP
.BR GameOnCD =(0|1)
defaults to
.IR 0 .


.TP
.BR GameDataPath =PATH
Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's 
.IR data .


.TP
.BR GameOverridePath =PATH
Path to the original game's override dir, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's 
.IR override .
Original games use this directory to place last-minute patches.

.TP
.BR GemRBOverridePath =PATH
Path where gemrb looks for its game override directory.
It defaults to
.IR GemRBPath .
The original games hardcoded this information in the engine.
