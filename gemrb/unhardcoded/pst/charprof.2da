# CHARPROF.2DA

# Unhardcoded table to control the individual progression of weapon proficiency points in PST
# This table defines the total points each character should have at each fighter level
# 2e D&D rules are only loosely followed, as each character has limited weapon options.
# The progression was judiciously spread out over the character levels you actually meet the NPCS

# Values drawn up by testing the original game:

# Dakkon and Annah get a point when their fighter level hits 5, 8, 11, capped at 4
# Morte starts with 2 points, and also gets one at 5,8,11, capped at 5
# Vhailor starts with 2 at level 9, gets a point at 11, 14 then 17 capped at 5
# Then Nordom spoils the pattern by getting a point at lv 13 instead of 14

# Grace and Ignus do not recieve proficiencies at all. This can be changed by modifiying the table.

# TNO starts the game at level 3, with 2 spent and 3 unspent points,
# then gains one at level 6 and every three fighter levels thereafter,
# regardless of how many levels in other classes. This continues after level 20.
# However his ability to spend proficiencies in a particular weapon is capped according to his class specialisation
