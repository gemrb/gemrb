 return vector of Points composing a circle of specified radius at origin
 since the points are ordered by octant, they are suitable for connecting as lines to create a filled circle

 PlotCircle uses the laws of symmetry to draw up to 8 octants (using all 8 yields a complete circle) of a circle at once
 The octants parameter is a bitfield where each bit corresponds to an octant. See the diagram to understand how they are ordered.
