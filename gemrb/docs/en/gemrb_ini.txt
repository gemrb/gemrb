Introduction
------------ 

gemrb.ini is a file containing game-specific configuration for GemRB
engine.  It's used for options with simple value types which are
specific to GemRB and which are not intended to be usually changed by
a user. More complicated configuration data (tables, etc.) are kept in
their own files. User specific configuration is in other file (GemRB.cfg).

[FIXME: eventually, this file could be searched for in user's config directory too]

This file's path can be 
  <source_dir>/gemrb/override/<game_type>/gemrb.ini
  <install_share_dir>/gemrb/override/<game_type>/gemrb.ini
  <install_dir>/override/<game_type>/gemrb.ini


INI File Format
---------------

gemrb.ini file is in Windows *.INI format. That means it's line
oriented, consisting of a list of options, each on its own
line. Options are grouped into sections, each section labeled with
section name in [brackets]. Comments have to be on their own line, they
start with a semicolon (;) and last to the end of the line.

Options are in this file described in the format optionname = <type>.
For the moment all the options have to be in [resources] section.


Options Values Types
--------------------
These are types of values used in description of particular options.

  resref - resource identifier as defined in KEY file, string of at most
      8 characters. The case is not important, but is usually written in
      all upper-case to be easily distinguished.

  string

  rgba_color - hexadecimal RGBA quadruplet written as #rrggbbaa, 
      e.g. #00ff00ff is opaque bright green.

  number - unsigned integer number

  bool - boolean value, for now either 0 (false) or 1 (true)
