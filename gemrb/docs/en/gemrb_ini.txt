Introduction
------------ 

gemrb.ini is a file containing game-specific configuration for GemRB
engine.  It's used for options with simple value types which are
specific to GemRB and which are not intended to be usually changed by
a user. More complicated configuration data (tables, etc.) are kept in
their own files. User specific configuration is in other file (GemRB.cfg).

Options that do not deal strictly with data availability and diversity
may be freely changed. Some that may be interesting to users include:
AutoSearchHidden, BreakableWeapons, DeathOnZeroStat,
HasSpecificDamageBonus (mod required), SimplifiedDisruption,
HealOn100Plus, KnowWorld, ProperBackstab, SelectiveMagicRes,
ShopsRechargeItems, StealIsAttack and TeamMovement.

[FIXME: eventually, this file could be searched for in user's config directory too]

This file's path can be 
  <source_dir>/gemrb/override/<game_type>/gemrb.ini
  <install_share_dir>/gemrb/override/<game_type>/gemrb.ini
  <install_dir>/override/<game_type>/gemrb.ini


INI File Format
---------------

gemrb.ini file is in Windows *.INI format. That means it's line
oriented, consisting of a list of options, each on its own
line. Options are grouped into sections, each section labeled with
section name in [brackets]. Comments have to be on their own line, they
start with a semicolon (;) and last to the end of the line.

Options are in this file described in the format optionname = <type>.
For the moment all the options have to be in [resources] section.


Options Values Types
--------------------
These are types of values used in description of particular options.

  resref - resource identifier as defined in KEY file, string of at most
      8 characters. The case is not important, but is usually written in
      all upper-case to be easily distinguished.

  string

  rgba_color - hexadecimal RGBA quadruplet written as #rrggbbaa, 
      e.g. #00ff00ff is opaque bright green.

  number - unsigned integer number

  bool - boolean value, for now either 0 (false) or 1 (true)
