BUILDING GEMRB FROM GIT SOURCES ON WINDOWS
---------------------------------------


Tools you will need to build GemRB from GIT:
  - git
  - cmake
  - MinGW automated installer and utilities (base, g++, make)

Libraries:
  - ZLib
  - Python 2.3 or better, compiled with shared libraries
  - SDL 1.2
  - OpenAL

Building GemRB
----------------------------

The following commands will try to configure, make and install GemRB.
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -G "MinGW MakeFiles"
  mingw32-make
  mingw32-make install

By default, GemRB is installed into c:\Program Files\GemRB . Supporting
files are mostly installed into the same directory.
