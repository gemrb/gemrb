Description: This table describes how the pathfinder must handle the searchmap entries. Also it sets the cost of reaching a neighbouring point.

Columns: <N/A>

Rows: The first row contains 16 bitfields, one for each search map value. The bits make it possible to have an opaque, but passable area (but this isn't too meaningful).
1 - passable (can walk through)
2 - travel region
4 - opaque (can't see through)
(As you can see 14 marks the travel region).
The second row contains the cost of walking straight, and the additional cost of walking diagonals.

Example (BG2):
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f
PASSABLE 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 3 1
COST  10 4
