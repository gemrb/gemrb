Description: This table lists fonts. Only fonts listed here could be used as a font resource.

Note: the font system is described in depth on the wiki: http://gemrb.sourceforge.net/wiki/doku.php?id=plugins:ttf

Columns: RESREF  - the .bam ResRef of the font
   NEED_PALETTE  - if the font has no own palette, set this to 1
     FIRST_CHAR  - usually 33 (33 = ! in ASCII), it contains the first printable character of the font as an ASCII value.
      LAST_CHAR  - the last printable character of the font as an (extended) ASCII value.

Note: the following columns are used primarily for non-BAM fonts.

      FONT_NAME  - used to map a non-BAM font to a BAM ResRef.
        PT_SIZE  - the pt size of the font.
          STYLE  - a numeric value representing: normal, bold, italic, underline.
          COLOR  - RGBA hexadecimal representation to use for coloring the font.

Rows: <rowcount> - make sure the 9. font is a 'normal' font. Used for floating texts. (this is a hacked legacy feature, it may go away).
