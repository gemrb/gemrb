Prototype: GemRB.GetString(Strref, Flags)

Description: Returns string for given strref. Usually, you don't need to resolve a string before use, you can use SetText with an strref parameter. This command lets you alter the string. For example, if you want to add a level value, you'll need this.

Parameters: Strref - a string index from the dialog.tlk table.
             Flags - a bitfield

Values for the flags:
1   - strref on
2   - play attached sound
4   - speech (stop previous sound)
256 - strref off (overrides cfg)

Return value: A string with resolved tokens. To resolve %d's, you must either use StatComment, or do it manually.

Example: GemRB.SetText (Window, Label, GemRB.GetString(12137)+str(level+1) )
The above example will display "Level: <LEVEL>" in the addressed label.
