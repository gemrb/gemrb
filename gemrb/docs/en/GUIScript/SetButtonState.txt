Prototype: GemRB.SetButtonState(WindowIndex, ControlIndex, State)

Metaclass Prototype: SetState(State)

Description: Sets the state of a Button Control. Doesn't work if the button
is a checkbox or a radio button though, their states are handled internally.

Parameters: WindowIndex, ControlIndex  - the control's reference
State - the new state of the button:
IE_GUI_BUTTON_ENABLED    = 0x00000000, default state
IE_GUI_BUTTON_UNPRESSED  = 0x00000000, same as above
IE_GUI_BUTTON_PRESSED    = 0x00000001, the button is pressed
IE_GUI_BUTTON_SELECTED   = 0x00000002, the button stuck in pressed state
IE_GUI_BUTTON_DISABLED   = 0x00000003, the button is disabled 
IE_GUI_BUTTON_LOCKED     = 0x00000004, the button is inactive (like DISABLED, but processes MouseOver events and draws UNPRESSED bitmap)
IE_GUI_BUTTON_FAKEDISABLED      = 0x00000005, draws DISABLED bitmap, but it isn't disabled
IE_GUI_BUTTON_FAKEPRESSED     = 0x00000006, draws PRESSED bitmap, but it isn't shifted

Return value: N/A
