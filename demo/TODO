if ready by release, add to install targets, sample config (gametype!) and
 add instructions with a preconfigured config. Decide about including fonts.

CODE:
fix slow scrolling
fix missing tooltip crash
fix actor selection
set actor palette

DATA:
real bams for cursors (add as needed), tooltip bg
fist.itm is missing some resources like icons
dialog.tlk entries
(proper mapicon0.png)

add an infopoint somewhere
make the cave entrance, sides a travel region (to self)
add area music
add another actor
write dialogs
add a cutscene

CONSIDER REMOVING:
- mastarea.2da
- the fonts, now included for easier testing (otherwise add all the needed boilerplate)
