GemRB (Game Engine Made with preRendered Background) is a "port"
(actually a new implementation) of the original Infinity Engine (the one
of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, ...) to
Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows with some enhancements. Would you like to
create a game like Baldur's Gate?

It means that you either need some of the original game's data
somewhere on your harddisk, or you can try to use the data from the
Dragonlance Total Conversion project - see the link below.

The original game data has to be installed on a windows
partition and mounted to your Linux/Unix filesystem, installed on
windows and then copied to your filesystem, installed with WINE or 
extracted manually from the CDs using the tool `unshield'.


What little documentation exists is mostly in gemrb/docs/en/ and
subdirectories, the gemrb.1 man page and this file.

Supported (i.e. we got reports about successfully running GemRB) systems:

Linux x86, x86-64, ppc
FreeBSD x86
MS Windows
various Macintosh systems also should work ...

Requirements:

SDL 1.2
OpenAL 0.0.7 or above
Python 2.2 or above, with shared libs (binaries are compiled with 2.5!)
ZLib 1.2
Png 1.2 (optional)

If you compile from source, you will need the development packages!
