#### Bug description
Add a clear and concise description of what the bug is, in which game, who or
what is involved, which area is it in (if needed) ... anything that you
think will help with understanding and fixing the bug.

If the GUI becomes unresponsive, check the log â€” it will have a python error
we'd like to see. If you get a crash, it's even better if you can provide a
backtrace.

If you know them, include the file names (resrefs) of the relevant resources
involved, eg. scripts, items, spells, areas, creatures or sounds. You can
learn a lot by pointing at something and pressing ctrl-m, which triggers a
debug dump.

In case of complicated bugs or hard to reach states, please provide a save
game, so we can reproduce the problem more easily.
