GemRB for iOS

Developing without a certificate
--------------------------------
You need to alter the iOS SSK if you wish to develop without an Apple developer certificate. Instructions for this procedure are here: http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Xcode#Developing_without_Provisioning_Profile. This page has been archived in this directory as "Xcode - iPhone Development Wiki.html".

Required 3rd party libraries
----------------------------
* SDL
* SDL_ttf
* freetype2
* Python

These libraries should be placed in a sub directory to this one directory called "lib".
you will have to compile these yourself. Most have iOS versions available either officially or as special forks, but as of this writing I had to build Python myself which was a bit hair-pulling. 

put the binaries compiled for ARM in "lib/iphoneos" and simulator libraries in "lib/iphonesimulator".

the headers for these libraries should go in "lib/include"
